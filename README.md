## ‚ú®Latest Updates

Discord.js v13 will break this bot so do not use this with it. We have been started working on v5 which will be out in some days/months with new features and much more are on the way.

## üöß Prerequisites

- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [discord.js@12.5.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js/v/12.5.3)
- [Lavalink Server](https://darrennathanael.com/post/how-to-lavalink/?utm_source=github-sudhanplayz&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=sudhanplayz&utm_content=lavalink-prerequisites)

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work.

> Note: If you are hosting your bot in heroku, Please consider upgrading your dyno for running dashboard & bot simultaneously because in free dyno it'll run out of memory(as there are two workers). If you want to run only the bot, turn off the `web` dyno.
